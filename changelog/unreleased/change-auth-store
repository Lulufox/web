Change: Auth store to pinia

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: Auth information is no longer stored in a vuex store but in pinia instead. You can access all the store functionality via the new `useAuthStore` composable.

Note that the following composables have also been removed in favour of the pinia composable:

- `useAccessToken`
- `usePublicLinkContext`
- `usePublicLinkPassword`
- `usePublicLinkToken`
- `useUserContext`
