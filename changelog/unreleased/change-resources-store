Change: Resources store to pinia

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: Resources are no longer stored in a vuex store module but in pinia instead. You can access all the store functionality via the new `useResourcesStore` composable.

Technically the former vuex store was only supposed to be used inside the files app. However, it was reachable from the outside as well and was therefore quite frequently used by other apps. So we decided to declare this as a breaking change.
