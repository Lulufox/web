Enhancement: Accessibility improvements

The following accessibility improvements have been made:

- Contextual helpers now have a focus trap, meaning the user can't focus elements in the background while the contextual helper is showing.
- An issue where the current focus would not change when navigating the resource table/tiles with the keyboard has been fixed.
