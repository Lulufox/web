Enhancement: Faster page loading times

We've massively decreased the initial page loading times. This is especially noticeable with slower network connections.

According to the lighthouse performance metrics, we improved from a score of 60 to 94.

This has been achieved by taking several different actions:

- Lazy load large dependencies
- Improve chunking
- Enable server side compression
- Reduce the size of the main font we're using
- Only register translations for the currently selected language
