# OpenCloud Design System

The **OpenCloud Design System** provides you and your team with a set of components and utilities for 
application and extension development within the OpenCloud Web ecosystem.

The design system is bundled with OpenCloud Web, so you can and should just use the components and utilities
you find in this documentation. This helps us in building a common visual language for the whole ecosystem.
