# web-pkg

`web-pkg` is a package that provides utilities that can be useful when creating and developing extensions for ownCloud Web.

It's important to note that this package solely provides types and lacks an actual standalone implementation. This is because `web-pkg` is intended solely for Web extension development, and the real implementation is already provided by the Web runtime.

## Installation

Depending on your package manager, run one of the following commands:

```
$ npm install @ownclouders/web-pkg

$ pnpm add @ownclouders/web-pkg

$ yarn add @ownclouders/web-pkg
```
